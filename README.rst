Causal Reasoning with ChiRho
============================

ChiRho is a causal extension to the Pyro probabilistic programming
language. It was built to bridge the gap between the capabilities of
modern probabilistic programming systems, such as Pyro, and the needs of
policymakers, scientists, and AI researchers, who often want to use
models to answer their questions about cause-and-effect relationships.
As a non-exhaustive set of examples, ChiRho makes it easier to
answer the following kinds of causal questions that appear frequently in
practice.

-  **Interventional**: *How many COVID-19 hospitalizations will occur if
   the the USA imposes a national mask mandate?*

-  **Counterfactual**: *Given that 100,000 people were infected with
   COVID-19 in the past month, how many would have been infected if a
   mask mandate had been in place?*

-  **Explanation**: *Why were 100,000 people infected with COVID-19 in
   the past month?*

-  **Causal structure discovery**: *What individual attributes influence
   risk of COVID-19 hospitalization?*

To see how ChiRho supports causal reasoning, take a look at our `Tutorial <https://basisresearch.github.io/chirho/tutorial_i.html>`_.

Installation
------------

**Install using pip:**

.. code:: sh

   pip install chirho

**Install from source:**

.. code:: sh

   git clone git@github.com:BasisResearch/chirho.git
   cd chirho
   git checkout master
   pip install .

**Install with extra packages:**

To install the dependencies required to run the tutorials in
``examples``/``tutorials`` directories, please use the following
command:

.. code:: sh

   pip install chirho[extras] 

Make sure that the models come from the same release version of the
`ChiRho source
code <https://github.com/BasisResearch/chirho/releases>`__ as you
have installed.

Getting Started
---------------

Below is a simple example of how to use ChiRho to answer an
interventional question. For more in-depth examples, go to `Learn
more <#learn-more>`__.

.. code:: python

   import torch
   import pyro
   import pyro.distributions as dist
   from chirho.interventional.handlers import do

   pyro.set_rng_seed(101)

   # Define a causal model with single confounder h
   def model():
       h = pyro.sample("h", dist.Normal(0, 1))
       x = pyro.sample("x", dist.Normal(h, 1))
       y = pyro.sample("y", dist.Normal(x + h, 1))
       return y

   # Define a causal query (here intervening on x)
   def queried_model():
       return do(model, {"x": 1})

   # Generate 10,000 samples from the observational distribution P(y) ~ N(0, 2)
   obs_samples = pyro.infer.Predictive(model, num_samples=1000)()["y"]

   # Generate 10,000 samples from the interventional distribution P(y | do(X=1)) ~ N(1, 1)
   int_samples = pyro.infer.Predictive(queried_model(), num_samples=1000)()["y"]

We have written a number of tutorials and examples for ChiRho. We
have tried to choose simple examples that would be of interest to both
the causal inference and probabilistic programming communities: they
collectively span Pearl’s causal hierarchy (Pearl 2009), and
most are broadly applicable, empirically validated, have an
unconventional or limited identification result, and make use of modern
probabilistic machine learning tools, like neural networks or stochastic
variational inference.

Our examples demonstrate how real-world causal assumptions can be expressed as probabilistic programs 
and real-world causal estimands can be expressed as program transformations.
These example illustrate how ChiRho is compatible with any inference method 
implemented in Pyro, including the kinds of scalable gradient-based
approximations that power much of the modern probabilistic machine learning landscape.

Caveats
-------
ChiRho does not answer causal questions by magic. In fact, there is
no escaping the fact that

   *behind any causal conclusion there must lie some causal assumption,*

a phrase made famous by Judea Pearl (Pearl 2009). Instead,
ChiRho provides a substrate for writing causal assumptions as
probabilistic programs, and for writing causal questions in terms of
program transformations.
