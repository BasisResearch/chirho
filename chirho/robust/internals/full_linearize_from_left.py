    If the user wants to analyze the influence of the prior on the functional of the posterior,
     they'll have to implement the functional with importance sampling wrt the guide so that
     (can we use the importance trace machinery from BatchedNMCLogMarginalLikelihood?).
    I.e. whether the influence is wrt the prior or the posterior approximation, this code
