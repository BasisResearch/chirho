    :class:`IndexSet` s represent the support of an indexed value, primarily
    those created using :func:`intervene` and :class:`MultiWorldCounterfactual`
    for which free variables correspond to single interventions and indices
    to worlds where that intervention either did or did not happen.

    :class:`IndexSet` can be understood conceptually as generalizing :class:`torch.Size`
    from multidimensional arrays to arbitrary values, from positional to named dimensions,
    and from bounded integer interval supports to finite sets of positive integers.

    :class:`IndexSet` s are implemented as :class:`dict` s with
    :class:`str` s as keys corresponding to names of free index variables
    and :class:`set` s of positive :class:`int` s as values corresponding
    to the values of the index variables where the indexed value is defined.

    For example, the following :class:`IndexSet` represents
    the sets of indices of the free variables ``x`` and ``y``
    for which a value is defined::

        >>> IndexSet(x={0, 1}, y={2, 3}})
        {"x": {0, 1}, "y": {2, 3}}

    :class:`IndexSet` 's constructor will automatically drop empty entries
    and attempt to convert input values to :class:`set` s::

        >>> IndexSet(x=[0, 0, 1], y=set(), z=2)
        {"x": {0, 1}, "z": {2}}

    :class:`IndexSet` s are also hashable and can be used as keys in :class:`dict` s::

        >>> indexset = IndexSet(x={0, 1}, y={2, 3}})
        >>> indexset in {indexset: 1}
        True

    Get a :class:`IndexSet` of indices on which an indexed value is supported.
    :func:`indices_of` is useful in conjunction with :class:`MultiWorldCounterfactual`

    For example, in a model with an outcome variable ``Y`` and a treatment variable
    ``T`` that has been intervened on, ``T`` and ``Y`` are both indexed by ``"T"``::

        Fully general versions of :func:`indices_of` , :func:`gather`
        and :func:`scatter` would require a dependent broadcasting semantics
        for indexed values, as is the case in sparse or masked array libraries
        like ``torch.sparse`` or relational databases.

        However, this is beyond the scope of this library as it currently exists.
        Instead, :func:`gather` currently binds free variables in its input indices
        when their indices there are a strict subset of the corresponding indices
        in ``value`` , so that they no longer appear as free in the result.

        For example, in the above snippet, applying :func:`gather` to to select only
        the values of ``Y`` from worlds where no intervention on ``T`` happened
        would result in a value that no longer contains free variable ``"T"``::

            >>> indices_of(Y) == IndexSet(T_ax={0, 1})
            True
            >>> Y0 = gather(Y, IndexSet(T_ax={0}))

    For example, in a model with an outcome variable ``Y`` and a treatment variable
