Contributing to ChiRho
======================

Development
-----------

Please follow our established coding style including variable names,
module imports, and function definitions. The ChiRho codebase follows
the `PEP8 style guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__
(which you can check with ``make lint``) and follows
`isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`__ import order
(which you can enforce with ``make format``).

Dev Setup
---------

To install dev dependencies for ChiRho, run the following command.

.. code:: sh

   pip install -e .[test]

Testing
-------

Before submitting a pull request, please autoformat code and ensure that
unit tests pass locally

.. code:: sh

   make lint              # linting
   make format            # runs black and isort
   make tests             # linting and unit tests
