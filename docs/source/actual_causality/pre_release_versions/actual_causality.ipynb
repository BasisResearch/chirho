    "Actual causality (sometimes called **token causality** or **specific causality**) is usually contrasted with type causality (sometimes called **general causality**). While the latter is concerned with general statements (such as \"smoking causes cancer\"), actual causality focuses on particular events. For illustration, consider the following causality-related questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Friendly Fire**: On March 24, 2002, A B-52 bomber fired a Joint Direct Attack Munition at a US battalion command post, killing three and injuring twenty special forces soldiers. Out of multiple potential contributing factors, which were **actually** responsible for the incident?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Schizophrenia** : The disease arises from the interaction between multiple genetic and environmental factors. Given a particular patient and what we know about them, which of these factors **actually** caused her state?\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Explainable AI**: Your loan application has been refused. The bank representative informs you the decision was made using predictive modeling to estimate the probability of default. They give you a list of various factors considered in the prediction. But which of these factors **actually** resulted in the rejection, and what were their contributions?\n",
    "  \n",
    "These are questions about **actual causality**. While having answers to such questions is not directly useful for prediction tasks, they are useful for understanding how we can prevent undesirable outcomes similar to ones that we have observed or promote the occurrence of desirable outcomes in contexts similar to the ones in which they had been observed. These context-sensitive causality questions are also an essential element of blame and responsibility assignments, and of at least one prominent account of the notion of explanation (all of which will be explored in other notebooks). TODO add links\n",
    "\n",
    "The general intuition behind the notion of actual causality that we will focus on is that a certain state of antecedent nodes is the cause of a given state of the consequent nodes if there is a part of the actual reality such that if it is kept fixed at what it actually is, and we intervened on the antecedent nodes to be in a different state, the consequent nodes would no longer be in the observed states. A proper explication of this notion requires the context of structural causal models -  we first explain what these are, and then move on to the definition."

    "While statistical information might help address questions of actual causality, is not sufficient.  One requires causal theories that explain how the relevant aspects of the world function, as well as information about the actual facts pertaining to the specific case. For this reason, the notion on which we focus in this notebook is formulated within the framework of structural causal models, which can represent such information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion is defined in the context of a deterministic structural causal model (SCMs). One major component thereof is a selection of **variables**. For instance, in a very simple model for a forest-fire problem, we might consider a model with three endogenous binary variables: $FF$ (forest fire), $L$ (lightning), and $MD$ (match dropped) whose values are determined by the values of other variables, and two exogenous noise variables $U_{MD}$ and $U_L$ that determine the values of $MD$ and $L$. Moreover, some of those variables/nodes are connected by means of directed **edges**. For instance, in the example at hand, the model contains two edges that go from $U_MD$ to $MD$ and from $U_L$ to $L$ respectively, and two edges that go from $L$ to $FF$ and from $MD$ to $FF$. Each influence is associated with a **structural equation** - for instance, $FF = max(L, MD)$ indicates that a forest fire occurs if either of the two factors occurs. SCMs come also with a **context**, which is the values of **exogenous variables** whose values are not determined by the structural equations, but rather by factors outside the model. In our example, one context might be that both a match has been dropped and a lightning occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a causal model $M$ is a tuple $\\langle S, F\\rangle$, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S$ is a **signature**, that is a tuple $\\langle U, V, R\\rangle$, where $U$ is a set of exogenous variables, $V$ is a set of endogenous variables and $R: U \\cup V \\mapsto R(Y)$, where $R(Y)\\neq \\emptyset$, that is $R$ assigns non-empty ranges to exogenous and endogenous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To each endogenous $X\\in V$, $F$ assigns a function $F_X$, which maps the cross-product of ranges of all variables other than $X$ to $R(X)$. In other words, $F_X$ determines the value of $X$ given the values of other variables in the model (some of them might be redundant in a given equation). The intuition is that these functions correspond to structural equations of the form $X = F_X(U, V)$ which are to be read from right to left: if the values of $U\\cup V$ are fixed to be such-and-such, say $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$, this causes $X$ to take the value $F_X(\\vec{u}, \\vec{v})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **deterministic causal model** (also called **causal setting**), $\\langle M, \\vec{u}\\rangle$ is a causal model $M$ together with fixed settings $\\vec{u}$ of its exogenous variables $U$. To intervene, say, to make $Y$ have value $y$, is to replace the structural equation for $Y$ of the form $Y = F_Y(U, V)$ with $Y = y$. $\\langle M, \\vec{u}\\rangle \\models [Y \\leftarrow y](X = x)$ means: in the deterministic model obtained from $\\langle M, \\vec{u}\\rangle$ by intervening on $Y$ to have value $y$ $X$ has value $x$. Sometimes, instead of $X = x$, one might be interested in a more general claim $\\varphi$ involving potentially multiple variables, in which case the notation is $\\langle M, \\vec{u}\\rangle \\models [Y \\leftarrow y](\\varphi)$.

    "It is important to recognize that the straightforward counterfactual strategy, which asks whether the event would have occurred if the antecedent had not taken place, is inadequate as a definition of actual causality. A simple example can help illustrate this point. Suppose I throw a stone, which hits and shatters a bottle. However, just a second later, Bill also throws a stone at the bottle but misses, solely because the bottle was already shattered by my stone. In this scenario, the intuition is that my throw is the cause of the bottle shattering, even though the bottle would still have shattered if I hadn't thrown the stone. \n",

In particular, answering an actual causality query requires investigating the consequences of intervening on all possible witness candidate nodes in all possible combinations to have the values they actually have in a given model.

    "\n",
    "- **Forest fire:** one of the simplest structures illustrating conjunctions being actual causes, and how an event can be part of an actual cause without being an actual cause itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Doctors:** a simple example illustrating the intransitivity of actual causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Friendly fire incident:** a real-life example, to illustrate how the tools can be applied outside of a narrow selection of thought experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Voting:** this illustrates how on this approach a voter is only an actual cause if they can make a difference, but only part of an actual cause otherwise, which motivates reflection on responsibility and blame, to which we will come back in other notebooks #dTODO add links"
