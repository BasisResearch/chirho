    "\n",
    "In the [backdoor](backdoor.ipynb) example we saw how to estimate causal effects from observational data when all confounders were observed. In the [slc](slc.ipynb) example we softened this assumption, instead allowing some latent confounders to be shared between instances (e.g. students) belonging to the same object (e.g. school). In this example we again soften the restrictive assumptions made in the [backdoor](backdoor.ipynb) example, however using a different assumption about the relationship between potential latent confounders $Z$ and data $T$, $Y$, and $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this example we assume that every latent confounder $Z_i \\in Z$ is a cause of at least one \"proxy\" covariate $X_j \\in X$, $1 \\leq j \\leq d$. See Figure 1 in Louizos et al. [louizos2017causal] for a graphical description of these assumptions.\n",

    "Importantly, in this work we do not wish to make strong parameteric assumptions (e.g. linear structural functions) relating latent confounders, proxy covariates, treatment, and outcome. As we'll see later, we can instead approximate these local causal dependencies using probabilistic models with neural network components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In the original paper introducing the CEVAE model [louizos2017causal], the authors prove a theorem (Theorem 1) stating that the conditional average treatment effect is identifiable if the model is correctly specified, including a strong assumption about the marginal distribution over latent confounders $Z$. Recent work [rissanen2021critical] has investigated the consequences of misspecifying components of the CEVAE model, concluding that its derived causal estimate are in fact sensitive to these detailed assumptions about the generative model. While some more restrictive settings may yield more robust identification results or bounds on causal effects (e.g. binary variables [kuroki2014measurement]), to the best of our knowledge little more is known about the nonparametric or semiparametric settings."

    "### **Intuition:** Adjusting for confounding via proxies\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [backdoor](backdoor.ipynb) tutorial we discussed how to estimate causal effects with observational data by partitioning individual units into nonoverlapping subgroups such that each subgroup had similar or identical values of observed covariates $X$. When all confounders are observed, \"adjusting for\" confounders in this way produces unbiased estimates of the population-level causal effects we are interested in. However, this is not the case when some confounders are latent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we have made an additional assumption that all latent confounders causally influence at least one observed covariate, which we call \"proxy confounders\". Imagine for moment a scenario where this causal relationship is deterministic, bijective, and smooth. In this idealized scenario partitioning groups of individuals based on observed covariates $X$ produces groups that are equivalent to those we would have produced if the latent confounders $Z$ were in fact observed. This is true even though we don't know the true assignments of $Z$ for our observed data; as every subgroup will have similar values by construction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the relationship between latent confounders and observed covariates never satisfies this idealized deterministic property. Instead, the CEVAE model includes an explicitly probabilistic relationship between latent confounders and observed covariates, using neural network components as function approximators. With the previous caveat about identifiability and robustness of the CEVAE model aside, we can intuit that conditioning on these proxy confounders will update our posterior beliefs about which latent confounders are similar to each other, albiet without absolute certainty."

    "In this setting we wish to compute the *conditional average treatment effect*, $CATE = \\mathbb{E}[Y=1|do(T=1), X=x] - \\mathbb{E}[Y=1|do(T=0), X=x]$. The `do` notation indicates that the expectations are taken according to *intervened* versions of the model, with $T$ set to a particular value. Note from our [tutorial](tutorial_i.ipynb) that this is different from conditioning on $T$ in the original `causal_model`, which assumes $Z$ and $T$, and thus $X$ and $Y$ are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, in this setting the CATE tells us how much greater the outcome would be across all individuals with the same set of covariates if we forced those individuals to receive treatment relative to if we forced them to not receive treatment. Here, we are interested in the average only over that subpopulation of individuals with the same value of the covariates. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we're using maximum likelihood inference here, we'll first condition our model to update neural network parameters, and then afterwards transform the model with learned parameters according to the desired intervention. This two-stage procedure separates the computation for convenience, but could instead be implemented in a single inference run in an extended model like the [backdoor](backdoor.ipynb) and [slc](slc.ipynb) models."

    "## Causal Inference as Probabilistic Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [backdoor](backdoor.ipynb) and [slc](slc.ipynb) examples we only used Pyro's approximate inference utilities to estimate posterior distributions over model parameters, and then used those inferred (distributions over) parameters to estimate causal effects using ChiRho's interventions. Here the story is somewhat more complicated by the fact that we are estimating the conditional average treatment effect for yet unseen test data. Therefore, not only do we need to estimate model parameters as we've done above, but also we must estimate posterior distributions over latent $Z$ conditional on observed covariates $X$. Similar to previous example, any inference method available in Pyro could be used to estimate the CATE, including amortized variational inference \\[Kingma and Welling, 2013\\] as in the original paper \\[Louizos et al., 2017\\].\n",
