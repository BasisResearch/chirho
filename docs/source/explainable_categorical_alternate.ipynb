    "The **Explainable Reasoning with ChiRho** package aims to provide a systematic, unified approach to causal explanation computations. The package provides a single generic program transformation that can be applied to any arbitrary causal model representable as a Chirho program. This program transformation allows several causal explanation queries to be modeled in terms of probabilistic queries. This approach of reducing causal queries to probabilistic computations on transformed causal models is the foundational idea behind all of ChiRho and in this module, has been leveraged for causal explanations as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to illustrate how the package can be used to provide an approximate method of answering a range of causal explanation queries in causal models with only categorical variables. As the key tool will involve sampling-based posterior probability estimation, a lot of what will be said *mutatis mutandis* applies to more general settings where variables are continuous (to which we will devote another tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In yet [another notebook](https://basisresearch.github.io/chirho/actual_causality.html) we illustrate how the module allows for a faithful reconstruction of a particular notion of local explanation (the so-called Halpern-Pearl modified definition of actual causality [(J. Halpern, MIT Press, 2016)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537131/actual-causality/)), which inspired some of the conceptual steps underlying the current implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, the readers should go through the introductory tutorials on [causal reasoning in Chirho](https://basisresearch.github.io/chirho/tutorial_i.html). They might also find a notebook on [actual causality](https://basisresearch.github.io/chirho/actual_causality.html) helpful."

    "\n",
    "Consider the following causality-related queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Friendly Fire:** On March 24, 2002, A B-52 bomber fired a Joint Direct Attack Munition at a US battalion command post, killing three and injuring twenty special forces soldiers. Out of multiple potential contributing factors, which were actually responsible for the incident?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overshoot:** In dealing with an epidemic, multiple different policies were imposed, leading to the overshoot (the number of those who became infected after the peak of the epidemic) rising from around 15% in the unintervened model to around 25%. Which of the policies caused the overshoot and to what extent?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explainable AI:** Your pre-trial release has been refused based on your [COMPAS score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software)). The decision was made using a proprietary predictive model. All you have access to is the questionnaire that was used, and perhaps some demographic information about a class of human beings subjected to this evaluation. But which of these factors resulted in your score being what it is, and what were their contributions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions of this sort are more specific and local as they pertain to actual cases that come with their own contexts, unlike average treatment effects discussed in an earlier [tutorial](https://github.com/BasisResearch/chirho/blob/master/docs/source/tutorial_i.ipynb). Being able to answer such context-sensitive questions is useful for understanding how we can prevent undesirable outcomes similar to ones that we have observed, or promote the occurrence of desirable outcomes in contexts similar to the ones in which they had been observed. Moreover, these context-sensitive causality questions are also an essential element of blame and responsibility assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the use of `SearchForExplanation` that provides a unified approach to answer such questions on all levels of granularity."

    "As the previous example showed, the but-for analysis is not sufficient for identifying causal roles. This induces the need to pay attention to the membership of variables in larger antecedent sets that would make a difference (that is one reason why we need stochasticity in the antecedent candidate preemption: to search for such sets). But even then, the but-for analysis does not pay sufficient attention to the granularity of a given problem and its causal structure. There are asymmetric cases where the efficiency of one cause prevents the efficiency of another, in which our causal attributions should a be asymmetric, but \"being a member of the same larger antecedent set\" isn't. We illustrate using a simple example.\n",

Intuitively, Sally's throw is the (actual) cause of the bottle breaking in a way that Bob's throw isn't.

    "In this notebook, we have shown how `SearchForExplanation` can be used for fine-grained causal queries for discrete causal models. We further elaborate on its application in for different queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explainable AI**: If the phenomenon we're trying to explain is the behavior of a predictive model, we are dealing with a problem in explainable AI; but the underlying intuition behind the workings of **Explainable Reasoning with ChiRho** is that causally explaining the behavior of an opaque model is not that much different from providing a causal explanation of other real-world phenomena: we need to address such queries in a principled manner employing some approximate but hopefully reliable causal model of how things work (be that events outside of computers, or a predicitive model's behavior). **Explainable Reasoning with ChiRho** package aims to provide a unified general approach to the relevant causal explanation computations. At least a few major approaches to explainable AI (such as [LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938),  or [Shapley values](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Abstract.html))  are based on the idea that explanations can be obtained by perturbing or shifting the input values and observing the changes in the output. This to a large extent can be thought of as a way of evaluating the but-for condition: if the input value was different, would the output value change? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Applications**: Causal queries, specifically but-for tests are often used in [the law of torts](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-law/) to determine if a defendant's conduct was the cause of a particular harm. The test is often formulated as follows: \"But for the defendant's conduct, would the harm have occurred?\". A major philosophical position in the analysis of causality is that the definition of causal dependence should be formulated in terms of counterfactual conditionals (Lewis, 1973. “Causation”, Journal of Philosophy, 70: 556–67). On this approach, $e$ causally depends on $c$ if and only if, if $c$ were not to occur $e$ would not occur. (The view does not remain uncontested, see the [SEP entry on counterfactual theories of causation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-counterfactual/))."
