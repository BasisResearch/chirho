    "### Task: identify the (in)direct causal role of a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the mechanisms by which an intervention achieves its effect can have serious consequences for what treatments or policy changes. For instance, a smoking prevention program, among other things, might involve changing a person's work break habits. In this scenario we need to determine the extent to which the program's effect is mediated by this variable, which is an example of an *indirect effect*. Or, in a work discrimination case, we might want to examine how much the mistreatment of minority members is the *direct effect* of their minority status, and how much it is mediated by, say, education, to which they have lower access. While talking in terms of the distinction between the direct and the indirect effect is standard, as our example will illustrate, mediation analysis can be applied whenever there are two disjoint (sets of) paths from the input to the output variable, and we want to isolate and evaluate the impact that proceeds through one of them."

    "### Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a seemingly straighforward case where the underlying causal structure is *Minority* $\\rightarrow$ *Education*, *Minority* $\\rightarrow$ *Salary* and *Education* $\\rightarrow$ *Salary*. The traditional approach to understanding the direct impact of *Minority* on *Salary* would be to run a regression analysis with both *Minority* and *Education* as input variables, and *Salary* as the output. The resulting coefficient corresponding to *Minority* would be considered the impact of this variable, correcting for education levels. However, this approach assumes that there are no confounders between the mediator (*Education*) and the output (*Salary*). For instance, a confounder might be the subject's parents' socioeconomic status, which could impact both *Education* and *Salary*: *Education* $\\leftarrow$ *Status* $\\rightarrow$ *Salary*. In such a case, by conditioning in a regression analysis  on *Education*, which now is also a collider, we would open the path *Minority* $\\rightarrow$ *Education* $\\rightarrow$ *Status* $\\rightarrow$ *Salary*, potentially introducing bias into the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the impact of a treatment or a policy change, we need a further distinction. For instance, suppose a treatment ($T$) has a direct impact on disease ($D$), and also causes nausea, which in turn may motivate the patient to use a countermeasure ($C$) that may affect $D$. One question we can ask is about the *total effect* of $T$ on $D$, $P(D_{t} = d) - P(D_{t'} = d)$, where  $P(D_{t} = d)$ is the probability that $D=d$ in the intervened model in which $T$ is set to $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to determine whether the use or certain levels of countermeasures should be discouraged, we need to conduct a mediation analysis. But which probabilities should we compare? On one hand, with respect to any level $c$ of $C$, we might want to know if a given untreated patient would get better if treated, holding $c$ fixed. If we proceed so, we are interested in the *controlled* direct of effect(s) of treatment on $D$ (different levels of $c$, in principle, could be connected with different direct effect levels), $P(D_{tc} = d) - P(D_{t'c} = d)$ for various settings $c$ of $C$ and different settings of $t$ and $t'$. Alternatively, we might want to take the *natural* levels of $C$ in a given patient into account (say, we know their use level of $C$ if untreated would take some particular value $c$). In this scenario, we use the same formula, but we are only interested in what value it leads to when $c$ is held constant. In the latter scenario, which more realistically abides by the constraints our policy will have to obey, we are estimating the *natural direct effect*. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to see the difference is imagining it is possible to eliminate the nauseating effect of the treatment (notice how this intervention cannot be expressed in terms of the $do$ operator relative to this model, as it consists in the de-activation of a path, rather than setting a variable to a particular value). The question now is, whether this would in any way change the effect of the treatment. Estimating the controlled direct effect would not answer the question, as this change does not result in the population uniformly using a prescribed level of countermeasures. And in general, if there is no feasible intervention that can keep $c$ at a prescribed level, the controlled direct effect is not the estimand that we are after. In contrast, if we assume that each user sticks to their pre-treatment levels of countermeasures and we ask about the direct effect, we're estimating the natural direct effect. The general phenomenon is that controlled direct effect is of interest to a policy maker if the value of the mediator can be fixed by an intervention, while the natural direct effect is of more interest if the intervention is more nuanced.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the distinctions that we have made are somewhat convoluted, unlike in the other examples, we will also frontload the explanation with the corresponding definitions. Suppose we are given a model $M$ with graph $G$, we are looking at treatment of the intervention $X=x$ on $Y$, given a context $U=u$, assuming the mediator $M$ is set to $m$. The value that $Y$ would have after the intervention fixing $X$ to $x$ in a  context $u$ is denoted as $Y_{x}(u)$. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's rephrase the above. Consider two situations. In one, we intervene to set both $X=x$ and $z$ to be $Z_{x'}(u)$, that is, the value that $Z$ would have had we fixed $X$ to be $x'$-that is, intuitively, we fix the mediator to its no-treatment natural value. The second situation involves only intervening on $X$, setting it to $x'$, which  intuitively, no treatment. $NDE$ is the diferrence between the values $Y$ would have in these two situations. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the controlled setting, where we fix $Z$ to have a particular value, we may not be able to estimate the indirect effect. To do that, we would simultaneously have to hold some variables constant to block the direct path, which is not achievable.  \n",
    "Under some conditions (specified below), however, it is possible to identify the natural indirect effect. First, we need to define it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$IE ( Y, u; x, x' ) =  Y_{x',Z_{x}}(u)-  Y_{x'}(u)$$\n",

In other words, we want to isolate the causal role that family interventions play along the causal chain “Participation in family intervention $\\rightarrow$ reduced engagement with deviant peer groups and experimentation with drugs $\\rightarrow$ substance use disorder in young adulthood”. One might expect that participation in family intervention during adolescence reduces engagement with deviant peer groups and experimentation with drugs, which in turns reduces the likelihood for substance use disorder in young adulthood.\n"
